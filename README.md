#AI-Based Brain Tumor Detection System
Presented by Qbit Team

This project presents a deep learning-based medical imaging system that detects brain tumors from MRI scans. The system utilizes transfer learning and explainable AI (Grad-CAM) to provide reliable predictions along with visual explanations highlighting tumor regions.
